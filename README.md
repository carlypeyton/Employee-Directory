# Employee-Directory

## Project Description

This Employee Directory, built using React.js, allows the user to search through hundreds of employees, searching for or filtering employees by name. 

### Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

### User Story

```
AS A user
I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 
SO THAT I have quick access to their information.
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API (https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
```
